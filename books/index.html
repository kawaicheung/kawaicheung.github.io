      <p>
        We like to measure the quality of code by some series of metrics, how closely a codebase follows a set of indoctrinated principles, 
        or other deterministic means. But good code writing is equally subjective. One fundamental challenge all programmers face is how to 
        land on great namesâ€”names for properties, methods, and classes. 
        <em>Landing on a Great Name</em> provides advice on one of programming's most challenging problems, naming, through the lens of working on a real-world product.

      <p>
        <em>The Developer's Code</em> isn't about the code you write, it's about the code you live by.
        There are no trite superlatives here. Packed with lessons learned from more than a decade of software development experience, 
        I take you through the programming profession from nearly every angle to uncover ways of sustaining a healthy connection with your work.
