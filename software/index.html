			<h3>Starting down a new path to build, launch, promote, and maintain software as a team of one.</h3>
      <p>
        Most software is built with large teams, cumbersome plans, bulky processes&mdash;all the stuff
        that sours a developer's soul. <a href="/temperament">I won't accept it</a>. 
        And many of us are coming around to the idea that it doesn't have to be this way, especially today. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After selling <a href="https://www.donedone.com" target="_blank">DoneDone</a> in 2024, I've decided
        to dive in fully on the idea that certain kinds of software can be fully created and maintained by just
        one.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first product is currently well underway. It's called <strong>DnsDigest</strong>&mdash;an app to help us make heads and tails of DNS records.
        I'm hoping to release this by the end of 2024. Stay tuned.
