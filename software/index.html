			<h3>Building software as a team of one.</h3>
      <p>
        Most software is built with large teams. Cumbersome plans. Bastardized processes. 
        So much stuff on top of stuff that isn't the software. The stuff that sours a developer's soul. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past 15 years, I've worked on the same software product I originally created called <em>DoneDone</em>. 
        I've learned how to build a complex system 
        <a href="https://medium.com/on-building-software/how-i-build-software-like-a-musician-60e0b81c3af4" target="_blank">in a different way</a>,
        largely designing and developing it with a tiny team (and often solo), with little of the extra stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a time where you did everything you could to hide such leanness, remember? You'd say "We" instead of "I".

        Complexity for complexity's sake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because small felt vulnerable. <strong>Small felt wrong</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those days are behind us. And many of us are coming around to the idea that small is not only better,
        but getting down to the smallest of the small&mdash;<em>solo software</em>&mdash;is 
        the optimal way. The path to work fulfillment we no longer have to hide behind. 
        <strong>A way to truly do what you love</strong>. An escape from <a href="/temperament">the cargo cults of traditional software development</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After selling DoneDone in September 2024, I'm now diving 
        fully into this idea that <em>certain kinds of software</em> can be fully dreamed, created, and maintained by just
        one. Especially with the tools available today. Yes that includes you too, AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to create a few sustainable software products solo. Software that is enjoyable to make. The kind of work 
        that can fit my life as a 40-something dad with <strike>limited</strike> no free-time but still craves that kind of independence, 
        youthful imagination, and passion to make beautiful things I was full of twenty years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an evolving list of the kinds of software products that fit my tastes:
      </p>
      <div class="just-a-list">
        <ul>
          <li>Solves a problem experienced by a niche audience.</li>
          <li>Simple pricing structure (tiered or one plan) and lower cost than most traditional SaaS.</li>
          <li>Valuable but non-critical&mdash;Does not require "5 nines uptime" and 24/7 support.</li>
          <li>Small surface area with minimal use of third-party services or out-of-band processes.</li>
          <li>A target $USD ARR in the <strike>millions</strike> tens of thousands.</li>
          <li>A heavy lean toward authentic design and clear writing. The 5% that still separates humans from AI.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        Here's the kind of work life I'm trying to create:
      </p>
      <div class="just-a-list">
        <ul>
          <li>Work 9am - 3pm M-F, with the ability to change as needed.</li>
          <li>Spend plenty of time on things that aren't "important" (like noodling on design or code enhancements).</li>
          <li>Dedicated time to share thoughts (write and record them) when the inspiration hits.</li>
          <li>Modest, slow growth passive income. Wealth is important but not the primary factor.</li>
          <li>No standing meetings. Few a-la-carte ones.</li>
        </ul>
