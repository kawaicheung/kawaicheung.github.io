			<h3>I'm beginning a new path to build, launch, promote, and maintain software as a team of one.</h3>
      <p>
        Most software is built with large teams. Cumbersome plans. Bulky processes. All the stuff
        that sours a developer's soul. I've spent most of my career desparately avoiding this. In fact, for the past 15 years,
        I've worked on a software product called <a href="https://www.donedone.com" target="_blank">DoneDone</a>, 
        largely designing and developing solo or with one other person.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a time where you did everything you could to hide such leanness, remember? You'd say "we" instead of "I".
        You'd plaster stock photos of important-looking people off Getty Images on your company website. 
        Small felt wrong. <strong>Small felt vulnerable</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But many of us are coming around to the idea that small is not only better, getting down to the smallest of small,
        <em>solo software</em> is <a href="/temperament">the optimal way</a>&mdash;the path to work fulfillment we no longer have to hide behind. 
        <strong>A way to truly do what you love</strong>. An escape from the cargo cults of traditional software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        After selling DoneDone in September 2024, I'm now diving 
        fully into this idea that certain kinds of software can be fully dreamed, created, and maintained by just
        one.

      <h4>Product #1: DnsDigest (Fall 2024)</h4>
      <p>
        My first product is currently well underway. <strong>DnsDigest</strong> is an app that
        helps domain owners better organize their DNS records. 
        I'm hoping to release this by the end of 2024. Stay tuned.
