			<h3>I want to build, launch, promote, and maintain software as a team of one.</h3>
      <p>
        Most software is built with large teams. Cumbersome plans. Bastardized processes. 
        So much stuff on top of stuff that isn't the software. The stuff that sours a developer's soul. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past 15 years, I've worked on the same software product I originally created called <em>DoneDone</em>. 
        I've learned how to build a complex system 
        <a href="https://medium.com/on-building-software/how-i-build-software-like-a-musician-60e0b81c3af4" target="_blank">in a different way</a>,
        largely designing and developing it with a tiny team (and often solo), with little of the extra stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a time where you did everything you could to hide such leanness, remember? You'd say "We" instead of "I".
        Plaster stock photos of important-looking people off Getty Images on your company website.
        Create a Jobs page for positions you were never going to hire for. 
        Complexity for complexity's sake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because small felt vulnerable. <strong>Small felt wrong</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those days are behind us. And many of us are coming around to the idea that small is not only better,
        but getting down to the smallest of the small&mdash;<em>solo software</em>&mdash;is 
        <a href="/temperament">the optimal way</a>. The path to work fulfillment we no longer have to hide behind. 
        <strong>A way to truly do what you love</strong>. An escape from the cargo cults of traditional software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        After selling DoneDone in September 2024, I'm now diving 
        fully into this idea that <em>certain kinds of software</em> can be fully dreamed, created, and maintained by just
        one.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to create a few sustainable software products that are perfect
        fits for a team-of-one. Here's an evolving list of what kinds of products fit my tastes:
      </p>
      <div class="just-a-list">
        <ul>
          <li>Software that solves a problem experienced by a niche audience. </li>
          <li>Simple pricing structure (tiered or one plan) and likely lower cost than most traditional SaaS.</li>
          <li>Valuable but non-critical&mdash;Does not require "5 nines uptime" and 24/7 support.</li>
          <li>Small surface area with minimal use of third-party services or out-of-band processes.</li>
          <li>Software that is <em>fun</em> to work on and allows me to play around with things.</li>
          <li>A target $USD ARR in the <strike>millions</strike> tens of thousands.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <h3>Product #1: DnsDigest (Fall 2024)</h3>
      <p>
        My first product is currently well underway. <strong>DnsDigest</strong> is an app that
        helps domain owners better explain and organize their DNS records, and detect potential
        issues with things like DMARC and SPF policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm hoping to release this by the end of 2024. Stay tuned!
      </p>
