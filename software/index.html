			<h3>I'm beginning a new path to build, launch, promote, and maintain software as a team of one.</h3>
      <p>
        Most software is built with large teams. Cumbersome plans. Bulky processes&mdash;all the stuff
        that sours a developer's soul. I spent 15 years designing and building <a href="https://www.donedone.com" target="_blank">DoneDone</a>,
        the bulk of them alone or with one other person.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a time where you did everything you could to hide such leanness&mdash;say "we" instead of "I" or plaster stock photos of
        important-looking people off Getty Images on your website. Small felt vulnerable.
      </p>
      <p>
        But some of us are coming around to the idea that solo software is a better way. A path to a more fulfilling worklife
        that you don't have to hide behind. A way to approach design and development as an art. A way to dodge the 
        <a href="/temperament">I won't accept wasting my good years like that</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After selling DoneDone in September 2024, I'm now diving 
        fully into the idea that certain kinds of software can be fully dreamed, created, and maintained by just
        one.

      <h4>Product #1: DnsDigest (Fall 2024)</h4>
      <p>
        My first product is currently well underway. <strong>DnsDigest</strong> is an app that
        helps domain owners better organize their DNS records. 
        I'm hoping to release this by the end of 2024. Stay tuned.
